                            <p>My name is Zsombor Szőcs, a third-year AI and Data Science student at Breda University of Applied Sciences. I specialize in data engineering and data science, with a particular focus on computer vision and deep learning in Python. I'm driven by the challenge of teaching machines to see and interpret the world around them. Throughout my studies, I've also ventured into blockchain technology and web development, appreciating how each domain presents its own unique technical challenges and learning opportunities. My approach centers on understanding the problem at its core before pursuing solutions. Whether building models, transforming data, or developing applications, I focus on understanding the core challenge and its context before crafting solutions. Beyond technology, I'm shaped by years of American football, which instilled strong teamwork values that influence my collaborative approach. I find balance through the gym, fishing, and spending time outdoors, where nature keeps me grounded and focused.</p>

                            <p>Born and raised in Budapest, Hungary, my early fascination with technology and video games naturally led me toward the IT field. I attended an IT high school where I developed foundational skills in programming with C++ and C#, web development using HTML and CSS, networking through Cisco certifications, and the Microsoft Office suite. Upon moving to the Netherlands, I initially pursued International Business, attracted by its strategic dimensions. However, after earning my propedeutic diploma, I recognized that I missed the hands-on technical work and problem-solving that IT provided. This realization prompted my transition to AI and Data Science, where I found a field that represents the future of technology and presents continuously engaging challenges. Since making this shift, I've contributed to impactful projects, including training deep learning models with NPEC to detect and measure plant roots, and currently collaborating with Specifix on wrist bone segmentation using computer vision. My five years of American football during high school instilled valuable lessons in teamwork and strategy, principles that continue to influence my collaborative approach and how I tackle technical challenges.</p>

                            <p>Looking ahead, I aim to work as a Data Scientist and Engineer in a corporate environment, with a strong focus on computer vision. I'm drawn to projects that advance human wellbeing, whether that's in healthcare, where technology like our Specifix project accelerates surgical planning and reduces patient suffering, or in agriculture and environmental science, where AI can support sustainable farming and nature conservation. My vision is to contribute to solutions that genuinely benefit people, automating processes and solving real-world problems so society can move forward. I want my work to serve meaningful causes, projects where the impact is tangible and the purpose is clear. The future I'm building toward is one where technology doesn't just innovate for innovation's sake, but actively improves lives and addresses challenges that matter.</p>
